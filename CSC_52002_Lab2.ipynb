        "\n",
        "LoRA, or **Low-Rank Adaptation**, is a technique designed to **fine-tune large pre-trained models efficiently** by introducing learnable low-rank matrices into their architecture. Instead of updating all the weights of a large model (which can be computationally expensive and require a lot of storage), LoRA updates a small set of parameters while keeping the original model frozen. This drastically reduces the computational overhead and memory usage during fine-tuning.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Why LoRA?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Efficiency:** Reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly.\n",
        "- **Scalability:** Works well for large models like transformers but can also be applied to simpler models like MLPs.\n",
        "- **Parameter Isolation:** Fine-tuning multiple tasks without interfering with each other is easier as the low-rank adapters can be task-specific.\n",

        "   W' = W + \\Delta W, \\quad \\Delta W = A \\cdot B\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Freezing the Model:** The original model’s weights \\( W \\) remain frozen during fine-tuning. Only \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are updated, which are much smaller in size.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Low-rank Design:** By choosing a small rank \\( r \\), LoRA ensures that the added parameters are minimal while still allowing the model to adapt to new tasks.\n",
